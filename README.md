# PHP-Deploy

> can deploy a artifacts.zip (e.g. generated by hugo) to a no-frills-php-hoster

# Howto

- create a folder _php-deploy_ and put the files from _src_ there
- `curl -F 'data=@./artifacts.zip' 'http://localhost/php-deploy/upload.php?token=my-secret-token'`

## Exclude folders from being overwritten

In the `upload.php` file you can add your folder to the array:

```php
if(!in_array($dir, ["php-deploy", "logs", "usage"]))
```
